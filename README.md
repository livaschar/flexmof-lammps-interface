# flexmof-lammps-interface
A customized LAMMPS interface for FLEXMOF applications

This repository provides a modified version of the LAMMPS interface, specifically tailored for MOF flexibility analysis within the FLEXMOF framework. It includes enhancements and optimizations for interfacing molecular simulations with nanoporous materials, improving efficiency and usability for gas adsorption, structural optimization, and dynamic simulations.

## 💡 Features:
✔️ Seamless integration with FLEXMOF
✔️ Supports LAMMPS-based molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for MOFs
✔️ Custom modifications for force field handling and input generation

## ⚙️ Installation
You can install flexmof-lammps-interface directly from GitHub:

```bash
pip install "git+https://github.com/livaschar/flexmof-lammps-interface.git"
```

## 🚀 Usage
This package is designed to work alongside FLEXMOF and can be used for running LAMMPS-based simulations on MOFs.
